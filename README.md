java-sshtools_to_openssh
========================

Convert SSHTools keys to OpenSSH key format

Usage
-----
    ./compile
    ./run sshtools_format_key_file

You need j2ssh and apache-commons-logging and you need to place them in the
right place for both compilation and execution... (look at `compile` and
`run`) - I'm sure you'll figure it out.
